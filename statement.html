    <p>I am a studio practice art student whose art is mainly traditional. I have just started to
learn how to handle technological art tools as a way to expand and grow my art skills. Many of
my artworks contain fantasy themes, due to being interested in the genre when I was young. I
had no way to do art online, so my only choice was to use either pencil or pen. As I started to
draw more and more, I began to incorporate portions of my life experiences in my artworks(not
directly; metaphorically).</p>
<p>I am very much an introverted person, yet, I do prefer going outside to enjoy the breeze
and looking at the sky. As to why I like at the sky so much is due to the fictional creature called a
dragon. A large lizard-like beast with its amazing scales and can soar through the skies with its
enormous wings.  It gives a feeling of freedom when thinking of those things in tandem with
each other. Those what I mostly draw look like humans, they are truly creatures that blend in
with modern human society. I can only do so much with traditional drawing until I need to
express my characters in their fullest colors, which is why I am learning to do art online. </p>
